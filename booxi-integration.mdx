    4. Customer confirms booking details
    5. Appointment created in Booxi
    6. Confirmation sent to customer
    
    **Webhook Event Flow:**
    1. Booxi triggers webhook (created, updated, remind, etc.)

    3. Message template populated with booking data
    4. Notification sent to customer via WhatsApp
