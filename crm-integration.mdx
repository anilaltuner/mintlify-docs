## What Can You Do with CRM Integrations?

With Merx CRM integrations, you can:

- **Sync customer profiles** — Import customer data from your CRM to Merx automatically
- **Import segments and lists** — Bring your carefully curated audience segments as Merx user groups
- **Sync product catalogs** — Enable WhatsApp commerce with your existing product data
- **Trigger WhatsApp campaigns** — Launch campaigns from your CRM flows and automations
- **Track events** — Capture customer interactions and sync them back to your CRM

## How It Works

Merx uses a secure integration layer to connect with your CRM, supporting both **API sync** and **webhook-based triggers**.

### Authentication Methods

| **Method** | **How it works** |
| --- | --- |
| **OAuth 2.0** | One-click authorization through your CRM's login page. No API keys to manage. |
| **API Key** | Enter your CRM's API key directly in Merx for quick setup. |

Most integrations use OAuth 2.0 for a seamless, secure connection experience.

### Integration Architecture

| **Component** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **OAuth Handler** | Securely authenticates and authorizes connections to your CRM |
| **Sync Engine** | Handles bidirectional data synchronization between platforms |
| **Webhook Handler** | Processes real-time events and flow triggers from your CRM |
| **API Endpoints** | Exposes Merx capabilities for CRM-initiated actions |

### Data Mapping

Your CRM data maps to Merx core models:

| **CRM Data** | **Merx Model** |
| --- | --- |
| Profiles / Contacts | Chat_User |
| Lists / Segments | Group |
| Catalog Items | Product |
| Flows / Automations | Campaigns |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before connecting a CRM integration, make sure you have:

- An active Merx account
- An active account with your CRM platform (with admin access)
- WhatsApp Business API connection configured in Merx

### Step 1: Navigate to Integrations

1. Log into your Merx Portal at [portal.hellomerx.com](https://portal.hellomerx.com)
2. Click on **Integrations** in the top navigation menu, in CommerceHub

### Step 2: Connect Your CRM

1. Find your CRM platform card in the integrations list
2. Click **Connect**
3. On the integration page, click **Connect to [Platform]**

### Step 3: Authorize the Connection

1. You'll be redirected to your CRM's authorization page
2. Log into your CRM account if prompted
3. Review the permissions requested:
    - **Read access** to profiles, lists, segments, events, and catalogs
    - **Write access** to catalogs (for bidirectional sync, where supported)
4. Click **Allow** to authorize the connection

### Step 4: Verify Connection

1. After authorization, you'll be redirected back to Merx
2. The connection status should show **Connected** with your account details
3. You can now configure sync settings

## Configure Sync Settings

After connecting, configure how data syncs between your CRM and Merx:

### Sync Options

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Create Users** | Create new contacts in Merx for CRM profiles that don't exist |
| **Update Users** | Update existing contacts with data from your CRM |
| **Sync Properties** | Import custom properties as contact attributes |
| **Create Groups** | Create Merx user groups matching CRM lists/segments |

### Scheduled Sync

Enable scheduled sync to automatically import new profiles daily. This ensures your Merx audience stays up-to-date with your CRM data.

## Disconnecting an Integration

To disconnect a CRM integration:

1. Go to **Integrations** and find your connected CRM
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the disconnection

<Note>
Disconnecting will revoke Merx's access to your CRM account. Previously synced data will remain in Merx.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed

If the OAuth connection fails:

- Ensure you have admin access to your CRM account
- Check that pop-ups are not blocked in your browser
- Try clearing your browser cache and cookies
- Verify your CRM subscription includes API access

### Sync Not Working

If profiles aren't syncing:

- Verify your integration is still **Active** in the Integrations page
- Check that profiles have valid phone numbers (required for WhatsApp)
- Review the sync settings to ensure the correct options are enabled
- Check your CRM's API rate limits

### Webhooks Not Triggering

If campaign triggers aren't working:

- Verify the webhook URL is correctly configured in your CRM
- Check that the flow/automation is active in your CRM
- Review the webhook handler logs in Merx for errors
