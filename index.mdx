## What is Merx?

Merx is a WhatsApp marketing platform that enables brands to engage customers through personalized WhatsApp messages, campaigns, and conversational commerce.

## What does this integration do?

The Merx + Klaviyo integration allows you to:

- **Sync customer profiles** from Klaviyo to Merx
- **Import Klaviyo segments** as Merx user groups
- **Sync your Klaviyo product catalog** to Merx for WhatsApp commerce
- **Trigger WhatsApp campaigns** directly from Klaviyo Flows

- An active Klaviyo account with admin access
- WhatsApp Business API connection configured in Merx

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Navigate to Integrations

2. Click on **Integrations** in the top navigation menu, in CommerceHub

### Step 2: Connect Klaviyo

1. Find the **Klaviyo** card in the integrations list
2. Click **Connect**
3. On the Klaviyo integration page, click **Connect to Klaviyo**

### Step 3: Authorize the Connection

1. You'll be redirected to Klaviyo's authorization page
2. Log into your Klaviyo account if prompted
3. Review the permissions requested:
    - **Read access** to profiles, lists, segments, events, and catalogs
    - **Write access** to catalogs (for bidirectional sync)
4. Click **Allow** to authorize the connection

### Step 4: Verify Connection

2. The connection status should show **Connected** with your Klaviyo account ID
3. You can now configure sync settings

## Configure Sync Settings

After connecting, you can configure how data syncs between Klaviyo and Merx:

### Sync Options

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Create Users** | Create new contacts in Merx for Klaviyo profiles that don't exist |
| **Update Users** | Update existing contacts with data from Klaviyo |
| **Sync Properties** | Import Klaviyo custom properties as contact attributes |
| **Create Groups** | Create Merx user groups matching Klaviyo lists/segments |

### Scheduled Sync

Enable scheduled sync to automatically import new Klaviyo profiles daily.

## Disconnecting the Integration

To disconnect your Klaviyo integration:

1. Go to **Integrations** > **Klaviyo**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the disconnection

Note: Disconnecting will revoke Merx's access to your Klaviyo account. Previously synced data will remain in Merx.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed

If the OAuth connection fails:

- Ensure you have admin access to your Klaviyo account
- Check that pop-ups are not blocked in your browser
- Try clearing your browser cache and cookies

### Sync Not Working

If profiles aren't syncing:

- Verify your Klaviyo integration is still **Active**
- Check that profiles have valid phone numbers
- Review the sync settings to ensure the correct options are enabled
